# Taskao

Taskao is a small application for Android that would allow the user to organize his tasks and time, anywhere, anytime.

The app is still a prototype, using Java. It will be ported to Kotlin (someday).

Main points of the app right now:
- uses firebase in order to store the users and their tasks, so that their data can not be lost

Points for the future:
- an exciting and rewarding system, in order to motivate people to be more productive
- and kind of minimalistic look and customizable menus
- share tasks and accomplishments with others (a social media for work lovers, teams and students)
